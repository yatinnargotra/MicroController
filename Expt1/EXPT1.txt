Write an asembly level program to transfer block of ten memory location to the given other location
	1.transfer memory block starting from 20H to memory starting from 40H
	2.transfer memory block starting from 20H to memory starting from 25H

MOV A,#05H - Moves immediate value to accumulator
MOV A,05H - Moves the value at the location 05H
MOV A,@R0 - Moves contents of R0 to accumulator
INC R0 - Increments the value of R0 by one 
DEC R0 - Decrements the value of R0 by one 
DJNZ reg,label - It is one of the conditional jump statements, It states that Decrement Jump to location 

Algorithm:
1.Start the code. ORG 00H
2.Set the conter. 
3.Set the initial memory address from the blocks.
4.Move the contents. 
5.Point to the next address from both the blocks. 
6.Repeat Step 3 for the counter times.
7.End
